<h1>My personal website on Github Pages</h1>

❤️ I have the intention of showing my front-end skills although i'm a back-end developer.

🟦 Next goal: turn into a responsive website.

✅ It was a bit challenging making the border stay responsive, but I did it and I'm very proud of my work. 

✅ If you liked my project, feel free to use this as your inspiration
